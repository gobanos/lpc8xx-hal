    // The common peripheral clock for all UART units, U_PCLK, needs to be set
    // to 16 times the desired baud rate. This results in a frequency of
    // 1843200 Hz for U_PLCK.
    //
    // We assume the main clock runs at 12 Mhz. To get close to the desired
    // frequency for U_PLCK, we divide that by 6 using UARTCLKDIV, resulting in
    // a frequency of 2 Mhz.
    //
    // To get to the desired 1843200 Hz, we need to further divide the frequency
    // using the fractional baud rate generator. The fractional baud rate
    // generator divides the frequency by `1 + MULT/DIV`.
    //
    // DIV must always be 256. To achieve this, we need to set the UARTFRGDIV to
    // 0xff. MULT can then be fine-tuned to get as close as possible to the
    // desired value. We choose the value 22, which we write into UARTFRGMULT.
    //
    // Finally, we can set an additional divider value for the UART unit by
    // passing it as an argument to `BaudRate::new` (this will set the BRG
    // register). As we are already close enough to the desired value, we pass
    // 0, resulting in no further division.

    // All of this is somewhat explained in the user manual, section 13.3.1.
