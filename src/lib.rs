//! # LPC82x Hardware Abstraction Layer
//!
//! Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the NXP LPC82x series of ARM Cortex-M0+
//! microcontrollers.
//!
//! ## Using LPC82x HAL in a Library
//!
//! Writing a library on top of LPC82x HAL is pretty simple. All you need to do
//! is include it via Cargo, by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ``` toml
//! [dependencies]
//! lpc82x-hal = "0.5"
//! ```
//!
//! With that in place, you can just reference the crate in your Rust code, like
//! this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! // lib.rs
//!
//! extern crate lpc82x_hal;
//! ```
//!
//! That's it! Now you can start using the LPC82x HAL APIs. Take a look at
//! [`Peripherals`], which is the entry point to the whole API.
//!
//! Please note that LPC82x HAL is an implementation of [embedded-hal]. If your
//! library is not specific to LPC82x, please consider depending on embedded-hal
//! instead. Doing so means that your library should work on top of all
//! embedded-hal implementations.
//!
//! ## Using LPC82x HAL in an Application
//!
//! To use LPC82x HAL in an application, you need to enable its `rt` feature.
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ``` toml
//! [dependencies.lpc82x-hal]
//! version  = "0.5"
//! features = ["rt"]
//! ```
//!
//! How to upload your application to the microcontroller depends on the details
//! of your specific case. If you happen to be using the LPCXpresso824-MAX
//! development board, you can use the configuration in this repository to set
//! up the uploading process. The following configuration files are relevant:
//!
//! - `memory.x`
//! - `.cargo/config`
//! - `openocd.cfg`
//! - `.gdbinit`
//!
//! If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to upload your
//! application to the board using `cargo run`. You can test this out using one
//! of the example in this repository, by running the following from the
//! repository root:
//!
//! ``` ignore
//! cargo run --release --features=rt --example gpio
//! ```
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! There are a number of [examples in the repository]. A good place to start is
//! the [GPIO example].
//!
//! If you have an LPCXpresso824-MAX development board connected via USB, you
//! should be able to run any example like this:
//!
//! ``` ignore
//! cargo run --release --features=rt --example gpio
//! ```
//!

///
/// This is the entry point to the HAL API. Before you can do anything else, you
/// need to get an instance of this struct via [`Peripherals::take`] or
/// [`Peripherals::steal`].
///
/// The HAL API tracks the state of peripherals at compile-time, to prevent
/// potential bugs before the program can even run. Many parts of this
/// documentation call this "type state". The peripherals available in this
/// struct are set to their initial state (i.e. their state after a system
/// reset). See user manual, section 5.6.14.
///
/// # Safe Use of the API
///
/// Since it should be impossible (outside of unsafe code) to access the
/// peripherals before this struct is initialized, you can rely on the
/// peripheral states being correct, as long as there's no bug in the API, and
/// you're not using unsafe code to do anything that the HAL API can't account
/// for.
///
/// If you directly use unsafe code to access peripherals or manipulate this
/// API, this will be really obvious from the code. But please note that if
/// you're using other APIs to access the hardware, such conflicting hardware
/// access might not be obvious, as the other API might use unsafe code under
/// the hood to access the hardware (just like this API does).
///
/// If you do access the peripherals in any way not intended by this API, please
/// make sure you know what you're doing. In specific terms, this means you
/// should be fully aware of what your code does, and whether that is a valid
/// use of the hardware.

    /// would normally make.

    /// If at all possible, you should always prefer `Peripherals::take` to this

    /// 1. No other code can access the hardware at the same time.
    /// 2. You don't change the hardware state in any way that could invalidate
    ///    the type state of other `Peripherals` instances.

    ///
    /// Item 3. applies to all uses of this method, and is generally very tricky
